### REST (Representational State Transfer)

**REST** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- the HTTP protocol is commonly used for this purpose. RESTful applications use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) operations on resources, which can be identified using URLs. Here are the key principles of REST:

1. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server cannot store client context between requests.
2. **Client-Server Architecture**: The client and server operate independently, allowing for improved scalability and modularity.
3. **Cacheability**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable to improve client-side performance.
4. **Uniform Interface**: The principle of having a standardized way of interacting with resources. This typically involves:
   - Resource identification through URLs.
   - Manipulation of resources through representations (usually JSON or XML).
   - Self-descriptive messages.
   - Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS).

5. **Layered System**: The architecture can be composed of multiple layers (e.g., security, load-balancing) without the client being aware of these layers.
6. **Code on Demand (optional)**: Servers can extend client functionality by transferring executable code (like JavaScript).

### The Rebirth of HTTP in Java

The "Rebirth of HTTP" in Java often refers to the adoption and enhancement of RESTful services in Java applications. The following aspects highlight this evolution:

1. **Java EE and JAX-RS**:
   - **JAX-RS** (Java API for RESTful Web Services) is a set of APIs to create REST web services in Java. It provides annotations to simplify the development of RESTful services.
   - Annotations like `@Path`, `@GET`, `@POST`, `@PUT`, `@DELETE`, and `@Produces` are used to define endpoints and their behavior.
   
2. **Spring Framework**:
   - **Spring MVC** and **Spring Boot** have significantly simplified the development of RESTful services in Java.
   - Using `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, and other annotations, developers can easily create RESTful web services.
   - Spring Boot, in particular, has streamlined the setup and deployment of REST services with minimal configuration.

3. **Improved HTTP Clients**:
   - The introduction of better HTTP clients, such as the `HttpClient` in Java 11, which supports modern features like HTTP/2 and WebSocket.
   - Libraries like Apache HttpClient and OkHttp have also been popular choices for making HTTP requests in Java applications.

4. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - The adoption of microservices architecture has boosted the usage of REST in Java applications.
   - Frameworks like Spring Cloud and technologies like Docker and Kubernetes have made it easier to build, deploy, and manage RESTful microservices.

5. **Enhanced Tooling and Libraries**:
   - Tools like Swagger (OpenAPI) for API documentation and testing have become standard.
   - Libraries for JSON processing (e.g., Jackson, Gson) and XML processing have been crucial in the development of RESTful services.

6. **Reactive Programming**:
   - The shift towards reactive programming (e.g., using Project Reactor and RxJava) has influenced the development of non-blocking REST services.
   - Spring WebFlux, part of Spring 5, supports reactive programming for RESTful web services.

### Conclusion

The adoption and enhancement of REST in Java have marked a significant shift towards more efficient, scalable, and maintainable web services. This "rebirth" has been driven by advancements in frameworks, libraries, and architectural patterns that have made it easier to develop and deploy RESTful services in Java.
